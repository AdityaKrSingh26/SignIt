# SignIt
**Lingua Libre SignIt** translate a word in (French) Sign Language.

This extension allows you to translate a word into French sign language on any web page. When you read a text and come across a word you don't know, highlight that word, right click and click on the Sign it icon: the sign in LSF and the definition of the word in French will appear on a window. If a word is not available in LSF, we invite you to record it with our easy-to-use webapp on https://lingualibre.org. The definitions come from the French Wiktionary to which you can also contribute: https://fr.wiktionary.org.
