# Recording : Guidelines and Studio Guide

## 1. Lighting

Ensure good lighting by positioning yourself facing a light source to avoid shadows on your face.

### Good Light, Soft-Colored Background

- Ideal for signers as it fully utilizes multi-source and diffused lights.

## 2. Camera Position

Place the camera at eye level to make the lecture more engaging and natural. Use a tripod or stable surface.

## 3. Background

Keep the background clean and uncluttered to avoid distractions. A neutral background is often best.

## 4. Sound Quality

Use an external microphone if possible for clearer audio. Minimize background noise and echo.

- **Software**: Use Audacity for audio recording. [open Source]

## 5. Framing

Frame yourself well in the shot, leaving some headroom and ensuring you're centered in the video.

- Minimum framing: from belly button to 10cm (3 inches) above the signer's head.
- Maintain consistent framing throughout a series.
- Position camera at shoulder or sternum level.

## 6. Clarity

Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Avoid excessive jargon unless it's relevant to your audience.

## 7. Eye Contact

Maintain eye contact with the camera to engage with your audience.

## 8. Practice

Rehearse your material to smooth out any rough patches and ensure a confident delivery.

## 9. Technical Checks

Test your equipment (camera, microphone, and software) before starting to avoid technical issues.
